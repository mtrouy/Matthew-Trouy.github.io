      Howdy! My name is Matthew Trouy and this page is about my hobbies and interests. To start off I love to be outdoors. This ranges from playing any type of sport,
      going fishing, hiking, camping, or any other type of outdoor activity. I also like to take pictures of things happening around me and sort of document the world.
      Below is a list of my different hobbies and interests!
