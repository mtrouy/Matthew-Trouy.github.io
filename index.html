      Howdy! My name is Matthew Trouy and this page is about my hobbies and interests. To start off I love to be outdoors. This ranges from playing any type of sport,
      going fishing, hiking, camping, or any other type of outdoor activity. I also like to take pictures of things happening around me and sort of document the world.
      Below is a list of my different hobbies and interests!

    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
    <p>
    On top of these things there are tons of other things I would like to try out. For instance two things I would like to do are go hunting and skydiving.
      Both of these seem like something to me that would be tons of fun and like they would make great memories for the people I go with and myself. Trying new
      things is always something I am down to do especially if it has some sort of adventure aspect or food. Having things like this that I want to do helps
      excite me for the future and see beyond some of the day to day things that I have to do everyday.

    <h3>Summary of my Hobbies and Interests</h3>
    <p>
      In all honesty what I like above most everything else is getting to be with the people that I am close with. Whether it is friends or family I just like to
      hangout and be around them. It often does not matter what we are doing but I do enjoy being outside. This is why mant of my hobbies include or could include
      other people. At the end of the day I love to be around my people and spend time with them.
